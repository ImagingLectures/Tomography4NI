## Bimodal imaging 
A single modality provides a single view of the samples, which may lead to ambuguous readings that are harder to interpret. By adding a more contrast modalities, it is possible to reduce some of the problems that may appear during e.g segmentation.

# Tutorial
The reconstruction tutorial will be using the CT reconstruction tool MuhRec which you will have to install in advance.
There will be a support session on monday (May 17th) evening if you need help with the installation.

## Installing MuhRec
- Download the latest release of MuhRec from the [repository](https://github.com/neutronimaging/imagingsuite/releases)
- Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/neutronimaging/imagingsuite/wiki/User-manuals-MuhRec-Installation)

## Download data
The tutorial will be using a data set which you can [download here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/g5snr785xy/2)
